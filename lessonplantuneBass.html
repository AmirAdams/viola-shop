            Title: Double Bass Orchestra Tuning - 1 Minute Guide

            Introduction:
            Hello bassists in the orchestra! Let's quickly tune up your double bass in just one minute.
            
            Step 1: String Basics:
            Know your strings - G, D, A, E. G is the lowest, E is the highest.
            
            Step 2: Use a Tuning Fork or Reference Pitch:
            Orchestras often use a tuning fork or reference pitch. Listen for the pitch and match your G string to it.
            
            Step 3: Tune the D, A, E Strings:
            Once G is set, use the intervals to tune the D, A, and E strings. Listen for the resonance and adjust accordingly.
            
            Step 4: Harmonize with Section:
            Play open strings and harmonize with nearby bassists. Ensure your bass blends seamlessly with the section.
            
            Conclusion:
            Fantastic! Quick tuning keeps the orchestra in perfect harmony.
